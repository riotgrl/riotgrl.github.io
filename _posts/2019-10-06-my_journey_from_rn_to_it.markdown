From Healthcare to Histograms

I am an ER nurse with 13 years of experience and I absolutely love my career. I enjoy the fast paced environment and imteracting with so many different people.  I also enjoy the fact that I am coninuously learning new things because research and standards of care are constantly updated. Our current healthcare system is broken on many levels and it's burning healthcare professionals out at an alarming rate. I regret that I am among those numbers. My reason for leaving healthcare is because with each passing year, I am able to devote less time to my patients in the interest of meeting metric expectations and completing an ever growing list of administrative tasks. It has taken the joy out of nursing for me. Unfortunately, I know that I am not alone. During the first two days of the data science program at Flatiron, I encountered a number of other healthcare professionals who are also seeking an exit.

Caring for patients has always been my passion and it is hard to imagine myself doing anything else. Health Information Technology is the first and only other area in healthcare that I have a strong interest in. I took a short certificate program designed for nurses and I was surprised at how much I already knew. However, I was discouraged when I looked at the job market because it seemed that the most interesting HIT jobs required a much stronger background in tech than I possess. 

I chose data science because information is so powerful. However, knowing what information is most relevant and presenting it in way that is easy for others to process are crucial to harnessing that power. Data science also appeals to me because it is future oriented; you look at past information to help shape future outcomes and avoid potential problems. 
 
It's been my experience that as a whole, nurses do not tend to be tech savvy beyond the use of their phones. Quite a few nurses that I've worked with were not able to do some of the most basic tasks such as using cut and paste or changing the default printer to the correct printer. I take on as many tasks even remotely related to tech that I can. I've been a super user and helped roll out a new charting program.

My biggest complaint about my job is the charting. I'm amazed that no one has been able to create and implement a charting system that is user friendly to all departments, meets government standards, and can capture reimbursement reliably. The paper trail that still exists is unbelievable and a human auditor is still necessary to ensure maximum reimbursement. It's frustrating to rely on outdated hardware and cubersome software to do my job. If we updated just our hardware and made it readily available, I'm convinced we could increase efficiency by 50%. If we could combine up-to-date hardware with a comprehensive charting program that fit all our users' needs, we could use that time to focus more on our patients. From a business perspective, it's confusing to me why hospitals will adopt new medical technology but neglect to spend money on operational technology. It would be exciting to help find a way to bridge healthcare and technology more seamlessly.

My future in data science may or may not lead me back to healthcare, but watching how information was used at different hospitals has been eye opening. All hospitals use similar information to shape their policies and practices, but some hospitals are more successful at improving outcomes even though the information collected is largely the same. It would give me a great sense of satisfaction to use this information to improve such things as employee retention and patient safety. The idealist in me hopes that using my new skill set in this way could be my contribution to improve the over all healthcare system. Even if I don't end up in HIT, I am still excited to enter a field where the goal is to improve things.
